# home_manager_for_3dartists


## WORK IN PROGRESS
this home-manager configuration automatically deploys a base building block for your rice this nix configuration is geared towards 3d artists,

but in the future i will create nix-kickstart that  will leave you with good starting point for your configuration and guide through achieving what you want through writing documentation  


## GOALS

- ability to install home-manager by just running nix run .# 
- put an entire configuration into flakes
- separate my configuration from this repo
- use symlinks to point configuration to the dotfiles folder
- make a short postinstall script that will automatically do all the work for you(including a scripts like nixlink.sh)
- make this configuration distro agnostic.
- be really simple to modify and well documented to be build whatever you want!
